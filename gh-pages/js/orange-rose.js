"description": "Silk dupioni fabric in Peach Rose.\n\nMeasures 1 yard by 54 inches.\n\nDupioni (sometimes spelled &#39;douppioni&#39; or &#39;dupion&#39;), is a lustrous silk often woven from two different colors of threads, so that it shimmers or changes color in the light. Dupioni is made from an irregular, rough silk reeled from double cocoons or cocoons spun side-by-side which are interlocked, making it necessary to reel them together. It has a moderately crisp drape, fairly reflective luster, and a slubby texture.",

I will ship within 48 hours of receiving your paypal payment, usually sooner, and 24 hours of your check or money order clearing.    **Shipping charges DO NOT include insurance, however we highly recommend it.

"policy_additional": "CARE OF YOUR FINE GEMSTONE JEWELRY:\r\n\r\nPlease do not submerge your Gilded Peach jewelry in cleaning solutions. The proper way to polish your jewelry is to buff the metal surfaces with an appropriately treated silver or gold metal cloth. Gemstones can be buffed to a shine using a soft, non-abrasive cotton or satin cloth. Please remember, artisan made jewelry is not the same &quot;cookie-cutter&quot;, mass produced jewelry you will find in retail chain stores. You are purchasing unique, handmade designs and they require a little extra care and attention. If possible, store your jewelry in the box you received it in to keep your jewelry safe from the environment which can tarnish silver and weaken metal components over the years, particularly if left out in a humid environment. Care for your precious gemstone jewelry and you will enjoy it for many generations to come! ",

"title": "Choice of Morganite, Sunstone, Citrine, or Hessonite Garnet Pendant in Rose or Yellow Gold, 9 x 7 mm",
"description": "This made-to-order pendant can hold either a faceted morganite, sunstone, citrine, or hessonite garnet in an 18K rose gold-plated over sterling silver or 14K yellow gold-filled pendant setting. \n\nFrom left to right:\n1. Brazilian Morganite - 9 x 6.9 mm\n2. Tanzanian Sunstone - 9.2 x 7 mm\n3. Brazilian Citrine - 9.2 x 7.3 mm\n4. Hessonite Garnet - 9.9 x 6.9 mm\n\nGemstone information is below.\n\nChain not included (to keep prices lower for you), but if you need one, I have a variety for sale at: https://www.etsy.com/listing/192336971/chains-in-silver-yellow-rose-gold\n\nMorganite is a pink type of beryl (emerald family), named after J.P. Morgan, an avid gem collector. The color ranges from very light pink, looking nearly colorless, to peach and rose pink. It is the second-rarest color in the beryl family, second only to bixbite. It is found in a few places around the world, including Brazil, Madagascar, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Pakistan, among others. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl\n\nSunstone is a type of feldspar that shimmers and sparkles when viewed from different directions, an effect called shiller. Common sources are Norway, Siberia, and many USA locations. Oregon sunstone contains copper inclusions, producing golden, copper, and green coloring. \n\nSunstone is the official gemstone of Oregon.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunstone\n\nCitrine is a color of quartz, showing yellow to gold or brown colors. It&#39;s mostly mined in Brazil, and often found paired with amethyst, creating ametrine. It is often heat treated to enhance color.\n\nCitrine is linked to the planet Mercury, and also sometimes considered a birthstone of November, as it is often interchanged with topaz.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz\n\nThe use of garnets as gemstones dates back thousands of years, used by Egyptian pharaohs, ancient Greeks and Romans in jewelry. It is even said that Noah used a garnet lantern to light the way for his ark. Garnet is known as the traveler&#39;s stone, having been carried as a talisman for protection and to light the traveler&#39;s path. There are over twenty varieties of garnets, but six types are used for gemstones: pyrope, almandite, spessartite, grossularite, andradite, and uvarovite.\n\nHessonite garnet is a red, orange, or yellow type of the grossular garnet family, that typically comes from Sri Lanka and India. It&#39;s often been called &quot;cinnamon stone&quot; due to its color. Imperial hessonite garnet is a golden type of hessonite garnet colored by iron. \n\nGarnet is the birthstone of January, and comes in every color. It is also the zodiacal stone of Aquarius and is the 2nd anniversary stone. It is the state gemstone of Connecticut and New York, and star garnet is the gemstone of Idaho.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnet\n\nInsurance and tracking is included in the shipping price for US addresses on account of the item&#39;s value, but if you&#39;d like insurance/tracking on international shipping, please contact me first. Rates will vary depending on your location.",

"announcement": " Magnolia Wreath Co. specializes in romantic, vintage, rustic, shabby chic and my namesake magnolia wreaths for home, weddings, nurseries and holidays. I use the highest quality materials to insure that you are receiving a spectacular arrangement for your home.\r\n\r\nIt all started in the early nineties when I owned a floral business specializing in dried flower arrangements. And, for as long as I can remember, I have loved working with my hands whether sewing, landscaping, or floral designing. The creative process and end results have always brought me joy – I feel a great satisfaction to sit back and see what I have created. \r\n\r\nWhen I design with flowers I place all the flowers and greenery together and play with it until I get the right proportions, angles and color combinations and just the right amount of flowers to greenery.   I then permanently secure the arrangement to the grapevine wreath.\r\n\r\nI tend to focus on my favorite themes, which include shabby chic, vintage, cottage and rustic (romantic). Each one of my wreaths will tell a story whether it is marking the entrance to a chapel, front door, wedding, or just something pretty over a fireplace or bed. \r\n\r\nI love what my hands can create and am honored when you choose to adorn your home with my work.  My wish is that it will bring you as much joy as it did for me to create.\r\n",
